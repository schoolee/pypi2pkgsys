# Usage of pypi2portage #

## Setup ##

Because the ebuilds generated by pypi2portage is not a part of the official
portage, so PORTDIR\_OVERLAY have to be set. The default position which used by
pypi2portage is '/usr/local/portage'. So '/usr/local/portage' should be added
into 'PORTDIR\_OVERLAY' in '/etc/make.conf'. If you prefer some other places,
just add it and assign it in command line.

/etc/pypi2pkgsys/index.ini can be used to save the user defined configurations
and patches. The sections defined in the /etc/pypi2pkgsys/index.ini will
overlay the same named sections provided in 'index.ini' which distributed with
the pypi2pkgsys. The patches provided by user should be placed in
/etc/pypi2pkgsys/ too.

Because there are many broken packages in PyPI, even easy\_install can not
access them, I can not access them too. To avoid repeat failures in these
packages, log is important for us. All passed and failed packages are recorded
in log. By reading the content of the log, we known why the packages
can not be processed. Statistices is provided by pypi-logstats.py too.
In gentoo, the log is located in /var/tmp/pypi/pypi2pkgsys.log by default.
You can copy pypi2pkgsys provided pypi2pkgsys.log in pypi2pkgsys/patches to
/var/tmp/pypi/pypi2pkgsys.log as its start point, so you can utilize the
test from me.

Except to modify the distributed packages by patch, fixsetup.py in the package
root directory is executed if present, which can be used to move, copy files
in easier way. For the examples, see CocoPy-1.1.0rc-fix-structure.patch.

Because there are some big package files, such as basemap-0.99.1.tar.gz (97M).
And some download site is unlinkable for me. I want to cache the downloaded
files into my local machine, and I shall not have to download or link to them
again and again. The network actions consume most of my times in the develop
of pypi2pkgsys. Now if a package file is cached successfully, I can process it
without any network action. To use local cache, httpd has to be installed.

We have to provide a set of different options for PyPI online update or local
cache update, so I implement scheme support in pypi2pkgsys. User can choose
a group of prepared options from configuration files with just one command
line option.

Now two schemes, 'scheme-gentoo' and 'scheme-gentoo-local', are provided.
The first scheme is used to update, download from pypi.python.org directly,
and the downloaded files will be saved in cache automatically. After that,
the downloaded packages can be accessed from localhost cache by using the
second scheme.

A default scheme is provided for each package system, the default values of
options are loaded from it.

To access a option scheme, use '--scheme-[SUFFIX](SUFFIX.md)', the options in
[scheme-pkgsysname-suffix] will be used.

## Command line ##

Possible options for all of the three commands:
  * --scheme-[SUFFIX](SUFFIX.md): Choose the specified scheme.
  * --url: The url of the PyPI index.
  * --cache-root: The root directory of the local cache. If it is set to '', cache is disabled.
  * --cache-url: The access url of the local cache.
  * --unpack-dir: Where to unpack the downloaded package files.
  * --download-dir: Where to save the downloaded package files. When --cache-root is not '', this option is forced to be subdirectory 'downloads' of --cache-root.
  * --log-path: The path of the log file. If it is set to '', log is disabled.
  * --skip-broken: Whether to skip the packages which broken is detected.
  * --deps: Whether to generate the depended packages.

The options which is valid in pypi2portage only:
  * --portage-distfiles: The directory used by portage to save its package files, the default value is: /usr/portage/distfiles.
  * --portage-dir: The portage overlay directory which should be used by pypi2portage. The default value is: /usr/local/portage/dev-python.

The options are processed in consequence, the later will overwrite the former.

After the options, the required packages are listed. wildcards are permitted,
pypi2pkgsys will access to PyPI index / local cache index and find all packages
which match the wildcards. Version specification, such as >= 0.1, can be used
too.

The execution of the pypi2portage require root privilege because it has to
write in /var/tmp/pypi, /usr/local/portage, /usr/portage/distfiles. If all of
these path can be written by other user, you might be able to run
pypi2portage as that user too, but this is not tested.

If the requested ebuilds are generated successfully, you can emerge them.

## Examples ##
```
# pypi2portage Pylons
# emerge pylons
```
Scan all packages which are started by 'A' or 'a'.
```
# pypi2portage [Aa]*
```
Generate ebuild from localhost cache.
```
# pypi2portage --scheme-local basemap athenaCL 
```
