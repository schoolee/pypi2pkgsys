= Usage of pypi2pkgsys =

pypi2pkgsys provide there commands: pypi2portage, pypi2dpkg and pypi2rpm.
Now only pypi2portage is worked.

== Setup ==

Because the ebuilds generated by pypi2pkgsys is not a part of the official
portage, so PORTDIR_OVERLAY must be set. The default position which used by
pypi2portage is '/usr/local/portage'. So '/usr/local/portage' should be added
into 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY' in '/etc/make.conf'. If you prefer some other places,
just add it and assign it in command line.

== Command line ==

Possible options for all of the three commands:
 * --url: The url of the PyPI index, the default value is: http://pypi.python.org/siple
 * --download-dir: Where to save the downloaded package files, the default value is: /var/tmp/pypi/downloads.
 * --unpack-dir: Where to unpack the downloaded package files, the default value is: /var/tmp/pypi/unpack.
 * --deps: Whether to generate the depended packages, the default value is: false.
 * --skip-broken: Whether to skip the packages which broken is detected, the default value is: true.
 * --use-log: Whether to log the package proccess result? The default value is: true
 * --log-path: The file name of the log. The default value is: /var/tmp/pypi/pypi2pkgsys.log. You can copy pypi2pkgsys.log from pypi2pkgsys/patches/pypi2pkgsys.log as its start content. pypi2portage will updated it automatically.

The options which is valid in pypi2portage only:
 * --portage-distfiles: The directory used by portage to save its package files, the default value is: /usr/portage/distfiles.
 * --portage-dir: The portage overlay directory which should be used by pypi2pkgsys. The default value is: /usr/local/portage.

After the options, the required packages are listed. wildcards are permitted,
pypi2pkgsys will access to PyPI index and find all packages which match the
wildcards. Version specification, such as >= 0.1, can be used too.

The execution of the pypi2portage require root privilege because it has to
write in /var/tmp/pypi, /usr/local/portage, /usr/portage/distfiles.

If the requested ebuilds are generated successfully, you can emerge them.

== Examples ==

# pypi2pkgsys Pylons
# emerge pylons
