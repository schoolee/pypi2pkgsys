I write this package because the python modules installed by easy_install
are not known by distribution package system.

I'm a gentoo user, its portage is not updated for PyPI python modules. If I
install these module by easy_install, emerge do not know it. When other package
which is not located in PyPI require PyPI modules, emerge will install them
again. Usally with different version, so my /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages
become a mess.

So I think if all packages are installed by emerge, we can avoid the previous
problem. We can generate ebuild automatically if we can install PyPI modules
by easy_install automatically.

After some work, I found there are some PyPI module which is not standardized
enough, and the ebuild on hand do some hack on it. I think the better way is
to patch the original PyPI module to let it standardized.

pypi2pkgsys is in early stage because there are so many packages in PyPI
index. I shall update it step by step.
